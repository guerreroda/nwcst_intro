# Introduction to Nowcasting

**Course Overview:** This intensive training program is designed for public sector professionals involved in national economic policy and statistics. It aims to equip participants with theoretical foundations and practical skills to utilize an advanced nowcasting toolkit in Python/R. We leverage real-time structured and unstructured data sources to generate timely estimates of economic activity, thereby enhancing informed policymaking and resource allocation. It is built upon the methodology outlined in our technical note "Nowcasting Real GDP Growth in The Bahamas", which develops a data-driven nowcasting framework for small, open economies facing data availability challenges.
